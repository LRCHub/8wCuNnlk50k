Everywhere around the world,
Women talking my language.
Never thought that I would meet a girl,
Never gives me no anguish.
Well I met a girl from Omaha.
I met a girl from Omaha.
I met a girl from Omaha.
She never gonna make me crazy.
(Crazy)
She's never gonna drive me crazy,
No no no.
High society the best in show,
Never leavin' behind.
All around girls just wanna vote,
It keeps me shiver and shakin'.
'Cuz i met a girl from Omaha.
I met a girl from Omaha.
I met a girl from Omaha.
She's never gonna drive me crazy.
(Crazy)
She's never gonna drive me crazy, no.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey.
Oh I met a girl from Omaha.
I met a girl from Omaha
She's never gonna drive me crazy.
She's never gonna drive me crazy.
She never gonna make me crazy, no no.
I met a girl from Omaha.
I met a girl from Omaha.
I met a girl from Omaha.
Where'd she go?!
