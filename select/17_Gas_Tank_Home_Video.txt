I'm the one you want
But how long til that goes away
When I say yes to you
You flip the other way

I'm the one you want
But how long til that goes away
When I say yes to you
You flip the other way

You wont step for me
But I won't bend down any more
You wont step for me
But I won't bend down any more

Got you pegged like a wooden leg
Got you pegged like a wooden leg

Make your move
It's your turn to crush me
I'm standing still
As you bring it down

I'm the one you want
But how long til that goes away
When I say yes to you
You flip the other way

I'm the one you want
But how long til that goes away
When I say yes to you
You flip the other way

You wont step for me
But I won't bend down any more
You wont step for me
But I won't bend down any more

Got you pegged like a wooden leg
Got you pegged like a wooden leg

Make your move
It's your turn to crush me
I'm standing still
As you bring it down

Make your move
It's your turn to crush me
I'm standing still
As you bring it down
